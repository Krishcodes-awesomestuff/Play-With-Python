**GAME TITLE** Text Utility [Analysis]

**GOAL**

To help people in text correction in their day-to-day life with the help of text correction.


**DESCRIPTION**

We all write some stuff and some time we want to check
what we want to know how much word/letter i have written so I have planned to build this project.
This project will definitely help others to use the text-utility for their best practices in write up and
more features in future as per the requirements.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

I have implemented the gui for the UI with the help of tkinter [python library] and have implemented the buttons with it's backend logic that help to get the text corrected.
